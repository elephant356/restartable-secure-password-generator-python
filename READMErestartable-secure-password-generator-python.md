This program generates a completely random password. 

You can tell the computer how many letters, numbers, and special characters you want to include in your final password. 

You can view the set of randomly selected characters that will be used to generate your final password and if you like them, you can accept,
if you dont, you can decline and the program will start over.

You can then chose between an easy or hard version for your final password. 
Easy mode will generate a password with the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in that order. 
Hard mode will create a totally random password including the length of letters, symbols, and numbers you chose.
For example, if you input was 4 Letters, 4 Symbols, and 2 Numbers...
  Easy mode would look something like: aBcD!@#$12
  Hard mode would look something like: !D@2ca#$1B
